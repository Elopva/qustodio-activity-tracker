This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Assumptions
The data will be fetched from an API, simulated on app.
the app will become a SPA using diferent Routes, so I made a shared folder to reuse some common components

## Project structure
Use create react app as squeleton
in the src folder I made a folder for every big feature, inside that folder you could fins a component folder and a page folder,
the page folder will contain the containers.
At the moment this app has only one feature, Activity Tracker, so I dint add a router.
The shared folder  will any shared resource , components, hooks, context...

## Run
open a terminal and navigate to this folder, run : npm start
Will start a server in your localhost port 3000
